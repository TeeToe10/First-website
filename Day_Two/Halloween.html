        <p>Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on <b>October 31</b>, and Halloween 2024 will occur on Thursday, October 31. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, <i>Pope Gregory III</i> designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known as <b>All Hallows Eve</b>, and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, donning costumes and eating treats.</p>

        <p>Halloweenâ€™s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). The <i>Celts</i>, who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and northern France, celebrated their new year on <i>November 1</i>.

            This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a time of year that was often associated with human death. Celts believed that on the night before the new year, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of October 31 they celebrated <b>Samhain</b>, when it was believed that the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.</p>
